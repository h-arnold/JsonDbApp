# Documentation and Code Consistency TODO

This list tracks the tasks required to bring the project's documentation and code into alignment, based on the findings of the consistency report.

## Architectural Documentation

- [x] Update `docs/01_GAS_DB_PRD_Updated.md` to reflect the current "MasterIndex as single source of truth" architecture. The document currently describes an outdated fallback mechanism.
- [x] Update the `Collection` class diagram in `docs/04_Class_Diagrams_Updated.md` to illustrate its facade pattern, showing its delegation to `CollectionReadOperations` and `CollectionWriteOperations`.

## Feature Implementation & Documentation



- [x] **Correct Infrastructure Documentation**: The `docs/developers/Infrastructure_Components.md` file incorrectly attributes validation methods to the `ErrorHandler` class.
    - [x] Update the document to show that validation logic resides in the `Validate` class (`src/01_utils/Validation.js`).
    - [x] Clarify that `ErrorHandler.js` is responsible for error classes and handling, not input validation.
