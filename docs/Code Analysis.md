## 1. Database Class - Constructor and Initialise Method Trace

### Constructor (`constructor(config = {})`)

**Purpose:** Initializes a new `Database` instance, setting up its configuration, internal properties, logging, and service dependencies.

**Trace:**
1.  **Configuration Initialization:**
    *   Checks if the provided `config` is already an instance of `DatabaseConfig`. If so, it uses it directly.
    *   Otherwise, it creates a new `DatabaseConfig` instance, passing the `config` object to its constructor. This ensures that the database always operates with a validated and standardized configuration.
2.  **Property Initialization:**
    *   `this.indexFileId = null;`: This property is intended to store the Google Drive file ID of the database's index file. It's initially `null` and populated during the `initialise` method.
    *   `this.collections = new Map();`: A `Map` is used to store `Collection` objects in memory, keyed by their names. This provides efficient in-memory access to active collections.
3.  **Logging Initialization:**
    *   `this._logger = JDbLogger.createComponentLogger('Database');`: A component-specific logger is created for the `Database` class, allowing for detailed and categorized logging of database operations.
4.  **Service Initialization:**
    *   `this._fileOps = new FileOperations(this._logger);`: An instance of `FileOperations` is created. This class likely handles low-level file system operations (e.g., reading/writing files to Google Drive).
    *   `this._fileService = new FileService(this._fileOps, this._logger);`: An instance of `FileService` is created, which wraps `FileOperations` and provides a higher-level API for file management, abstracting away some of the complexities of Google Drive interactions.
    *   `this._masterIndex = new MasterIndex({ masterIndexKey: this.config.masterIndexKey });`: An instance of `MasterIndex` is created. This is a critical component responsible for maintaining a central index of all collections, likely stored in Google Apps Script's `ScriptProperties` for cross-instance coordination.
5.  **Logging Debug Information:**
    *   A debug log entry is made, indicating the successful creation of the `Database` instance and displaying key configuration parameters like `rootFolderId` and `autoCreateCollections`.

**Dependencies:**
*   `DatabaseConfig`
*   `JDbLogger`
*   `FileOperations`
*   `FileService`
*   `MasterIndex`

### Initialise Method (`initialise()`)

**Purpose:** Performs the initial setup of the database, including loading existing collections from the `MasterIndex`, finding or creating the database index file, and synchronizing collection data.

**Trace:**
1.  **Logging:**
    *   `this._logger.info('Initialising database');`: An informational log entry marks the beginning of the database initialization process.
2.  **Error Handling (Try-Catch Block):** The entire initialization logic is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle any errors during the process.
3.  **Load Collections from MasterIndex (Primary Source of Truth):**
    *   `const masterIndexCollections = this._masterIndex.getCollections();`: Retrieves all collection metadata from the `MasterIndex`. The `MasterIndex` is considered the primary source of truth for collection existence and their associated `fileId`s.
    *   If `masterIndexCollections` exist and are not empty, an informational log entry indicates the number of existing collections being loaded.
    *   It then iterates through each `[name, collectionData]` entry in `masterIndexCollections`.
    *   For each `collectionData` that has a `fileId`, it calls `this._createCollectionObject(name, collectionData.fileId)` to create a `Collection` object and stores it in `this.collections` map.
4.  **Find Existing Index File (Backup/Reference):**
    *   `const existingIndexFileId = this._findExistingIndexFile();`: This private method is called to search for an existing database index file in Google Drive. This file serves as a backup or reference for collection metadata.
5.  **Handle Existing or New Index File:**
    *   **If `existingIndexFileId` is found:**
        *   `this.indexFileId = existingIndexFileId;`: The found `fileId` is stored.
        *   A debug log entry confirms the discovery of the existing index file.
        *   `this._loadIndexFile();`: This private method is called to load any additional collections from the index file and synchronize them with the `MasterIndex`. This step is crucial for reconciling potential discrepancies between the `MasterIndex` and the local index file.
    *   **If `existingIndexFileId` is NOT found:**
        *   `this._createIndexFile();`: A new index file is created in Google Drive.
        *   If `masterIndexCollections` had existing collections (meaning collections were found in `MasterIndex` but no local index file existed), `this.backupIndexToDrive()` is called to write the `MasterIndex` data to the newly created index file, ensuring data persistence.
6.  **Final Logging:**
    *   An informational log entry confirms the completion of database initialization, including the `indexFileId` and the total `collectionCount`.
7.  **Error Handling (Catch Block):**
    *   If any error occurs during the `try` block, an error log entry is made, and a new `Error` is thrown, indicating that database initialization failed.

**Dependencies:**
*   `MasterIndex` (for `getCollections`)
*   `_findExistingIndexFile` (private method, likely depends on `FileService`)
*   `_createCollectionObject` (private method, likely creates `Collection` instances)
*   `_loadIndexFile` (private method, likely depends on `FileService` and interacts with `MasterIndex`)
*   `_createIndexFile` (private method, likely depends on `FileService`)
*   `backupIndexToDrive` (private method, likely depends on `FileService` and `MasterIndex`)

**Observations & Potential Optimizations:**
*   **Redundant `if (!this.indexFileId)` check:** In the `else if` block, the condition `!this.indexFileId` is redundant because if `existingIndexFileId` is falsy, `this.indexFileId` would still be `null` at that point. The `else` block alone would suffice.
*   **`MasterIndex` as Primary Source of Truth:** The design explicitly states `MasterIndex` as the primary source of truth. The index file seems to serve as a backup or a way to discover collections that might have been added outside the `MasterIndex`'s direct control. This implies a strong reliance on `ScriptProperties` for consistency.
*   **Potential for Race Conditions:** While `MasterIndex` likely handles locking for its own operations, the overall `initialise` method involves multiple steps (loading from `MasterIndex`, finding/creating index file, synchronizing). Without explicit database-level locking during this entire sequence, there's a theoretical risk of race conditions if multiple instances try to initialize the database concurrently. This might be mitigated by Google Apps Script's execution environment, but it's worth noting.
*   **`_createCollectionObject`:** This private method is called multiple times. Its implementation should be efficient. It's likely responsible for instantiating the `Collection` class and passing necessary dependencies.
*   **`_findExistingIndexFile`, `_loadIndexFile`, `_createIndexFile`, `backupIndexToDrive`:** These private methods are crucial for index file management. Their efficiency and error handling will directly impact database startup performance and robustness. Further investigation into these methods is required.

**Next Steps:**
*   Examine the private methods related to index file management (`_findExistingIndexFile`, `_loadIndexFile`, `_createIndexFile`, `backupIndexToDrive`).
*   Examine `_createCollectionObject`.
*   Proceed to trace the `collection` and `createCollection` methods.




## 2. Database Class - `collection` and `createCollection` Method Trace

### `collection(name)` Method

**Purpose:** Provides a way to get an existing collection by name or, if `autoCreateCollections` is enabled in the configuration, to create a new one if it doesn't exist.

**Trace:**
1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   `Validate.nonEmptyString(name, 'name');`: Ensures the provided `name` is a non-empty string.
    *   `this._validateCollectionName(name);`: A private method is called to perform additional validation on the collection name (e.g., character restrictions, reserved names).
2.  **Check In-Memory Collections:**
    *   `if (this.collections.has(name)) { return this.collections.get(name); }`: The method first checks if the collection already exists in the `this.collections` `Map` (in-memory cache). If found, it's returned immediately, which is the fastest path.
3.  **Check MasterIndex (Primary Source of Truth):**
    *   `const miCollection = this._masterIndex.getCollection(name);`: If not in memory, it queries the `MasterIndex` for the collection. The `MasterIndex` is the primary source of truth for collection metadata.
    *   `if (miCollection && miCollection.fileId) { ... }`: If the `MasterIndex` contains the collection and it has a `fileId`:
        *   `const collection = this._createCollectionObject(name, miCollection.fileId);`: A `Collection` object is created using the `_createCollectionObject` private method.
        *   `this.collections.set(name, collection);`: The newly created `Collection` object is added to the in-memory `Map` for future quick access.
        *   The `collection` object is returned.
4.  **Check Index File (Fallback/Backup):**
    *   `const indexData = this.loadIndex();`: If the collection is not found in `MasterIndex`, it attempts to load the database's local index file.
    *   `if (indexData.collections && indexData.collections[name]) { ... }`: If the collection is found in the index file:
        *   `const collectionData = indexData.collections[name];`
        *   `this._addCollectionToMasterIndex(name, collectionData.fileId);`: **Crucially**, if a collection is found in the index file but was missing from the `MasterIndex`, it's added to the `MasterIndex` to ensure consistency and to update the primary source of truth.
        *   A `Collection` object is created and added to the in-memory `Map`, similar to the `MasterIndex` case.
        *   The `collection` object is returned.
5.  **Auto-Create Collection:**
    *   `if (this.config.autoCreateCollections) { return this.createCollection(name); }`: If the collection is not found in memory, `MasterIndex`, or the local index file, and `autoCreateCollections` is enabled in the `DatabaseConfig`, the `createCollection` method is called to create a new collection.
6.  **Error Handling:**
    *   If the collection is not found and `autoCreateCollections` is disabled, an `Error` is thrown.

**Dependencies:**
*   `Validate`
*   `_validateCollectionName` (private method)
*   `MasterIndex` (for `getCollection`)
*   `loadIndex` (private method)
*   `_createCollectionObject` (private method)
*   `_addCollectionToMasterIndex` (private method)
*   `createCollection` (method within the same class)

### `createCollection(name)` Method

**Purpose:** Creates a brand new collection, including creating its corresponding file in Google Drive, updating the `MasterIndex`, and updating the local index file.

**Trace:**
1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   `Validate.nonEmptyString(name, 'name');`
    *   `this._validateCollectionName(name);`
2.  **Logging:**
    *   `this._logger.debug('Creating new collection', { name });`
3.  **Error Handling (Try-Catch Block):** The entire creation logic is wrapped in a `try-catch` block.
4.  **Pre-existence Checks:**
    *   `if (this._masterIndex.getCollection(name)) { throw new Error(...) }`: Checks if the collection already exists in the `MasterIndex`. If so, an error is thrown to prevent duplicates.
    *   `if (this.collections.has(name)) { throw new Error(...) }`: Checks if the collection already exists in memory. If so, an error is thrown.
5.  **Create Initial Collection Data:**
    *   An `initialData` object is constructed with an empty `documents` object and `metadata` including the collection `name`, `created` and `lastUpdated` timestamps, `documentCount` (initialized to 0), and `version`.
6.  **Create Collection File in Google Drive:**
    *   `const fileName = `${name}_collection.json`;`
    *   `const driveFileId = this._fileService.createFile(fileName, initialData, this.config.rootFolderId);`: The `_fileService.createFile` method is called to create a new JSON file in the specified `rootFolderId` with the `initialData`. The `driveFileId` of the newly created file is returned.
7.  **Create Collection Object (In-Memory):**
    *   `const collection = this._createCollectionObject(name, driveFileId);`: A `Collection` object is instantiated using the `_createCollectionObject` private method and the `driveFileId`.
8.  **Add to In-Memory Map:**
    *   `this.collections.set(name, collection);`: The new `Collection` object is added to the `this.collections` `Map`.
9.  **Update MasterIndex (PRIMARY source of truth):**
    *   `this._addCollectionToMasterIndex(name, driveFileId);`: The collection's metadata (name and `driveFileId`) is added to the `MasterIndex`.
10. **Update Index File (Secondary/Backup source):**
    *   `this._addCollectionToIndex(name, driveFileId);`: The collection's metadata is also added to the local index file.
11. **Logging and Return:**
    *   An informational log entry confirms successful collection creation.
    *   The newly created `collection` object is returned.
12. **Error Handling (Catch Block):**
    *   If any error occurs, an error log entry is made, and a new `Error` is thrown.

**Dependencies:**
*   `Validate`
*   `_validateCollectionName` (private method)
*   `MasterIndex` (for `getCollection`)
*   `FileService` (for `createFile`)
*   `_createCollectionObject` (private method)
*   `_addCollectionToMasterIndex` (private method)
*   `_addCollectionToIndex` (private method)

**Observations & Potential Optimizations:**
*   **Redundant Checks in `createCollection`:** The checks `if (this._masterIndex.getCollection(name))` and `if (this.collections.has(name))` are good for preventing duplicates. However, if `_masterIndex.getCollection(name)` returns true, the `this.collections.has(name)` check is technically redundant in terms of preventing creation, as the collection would already exist in the primary source of truth. The order is correct (check primary source first).
*   **`_createCollectionObject`:** This method is central to instantiating `Collection` objects. Its implementation needs to be efficient and correctly pass all necessary dependencies to the `Collection` constructor.
*   **Synchronization Logic:** The `collection` method's logic for synchronizing the local index file with the `MasterIndex` (`_addCollectionToMasterIndex` when found in index file but not MasterIndex) is important for maintaining data consistency across different storage mechanisms.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error logging and re-throwing specific errors are good practices.
*   **`loadIndex()` call in `collection()`:** The `loadIndex()` method is called within `collection()` if the collection is not found in memory or `MasterIndex`. This `loadIndex()` method itself can trigger `initialise()` if `indexFileId` is not set. This creates a potential chain of operations that could impact performance if `loadIndex()` is frequently called and the index file is large or requires re-initialization.

**Next Steps:**
*   Examine the private methods: `_validateCollectionName`, `_createCollectionObject`, `_addCollectionToMasterIndex`, `_addCollectionToIndex`, `_findExistingIndexFile`, `_loadIndexFile`, `_createIndexFile`, `backupIndexToDrive`.
*   Investigate `FileOperations` and `FileService` to understand how file interactions with Google Drive are handled.
*   Begin identifying unused methods and overall optimization opportunities.




## 3. Database Class - Interactions with Other Components and Private Methods

### Interactions with `DatabaseConfig.js`

*   **Instantiation:** In the `Database` constructor, `DatabaseConfig` is used to create or validate the configuration object (`this.config`). This ensures that the database operates with a consistent set of parameters.
*   **Accessing Configuration:** Throughout the `Database` class, `this.config` is accessed to retrieve various settings:
    *   `this.config.masterIndexKey`: Used when initializing `MasterIndex`.
    *   `this.config.rootFolderId`: Used by `_fileService.createFile` when creating new collection files or the index file, and by `_findExistingIndexFile` to search for the index file.
    *   `this.config.autoCreateCollections`: Used in the `collection` method to determine whether to automatically create a collection if it doesn't exist.

**Observations:**
*   `DatabaseConfig` centralizes configuration, making the `Database` class more modular and testable. The validation within `DatabaseConfig`'s constructor is crucial for early error detection.

### Interactions with `MasterIndex.js`

*   **Instantiation:** `MasterIndex` is instantiated in the `Database` constructor, passing the `masterIndexKey` from the `DatabaseConfig`.
*   **Primary Source of Truth:** `MasterIndex` is consistently treated as the primary source of truth for collection metadata.
    *   `initialise()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.getCollections()` to load existing collections into memory.
    *   `collection()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.getCollection(name)` to check for collection existence before looking at the local index file.
    *   `createCollection()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.getCollection(name)` to prevent creating duplicate collections.
    *   `listCollections()`: Prioritizes `this._masterIndex.getCollections()` to list all collection names.
    *   `dropCollection()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.getCollection(name)` to verify existence before deletion and `this._masterIndex.removeCollection(name)` to remove it from the primary index.
    *   `_loadIndexFile()`: Synchronizes collections found in the local index file to `MasterIndex` if they are missing there.
    *   `_addCollectionToMasterIndex()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.addCollection()` to add new collection metadata.
    *   `_removeCollectionFromMasterIndex()`: Calls `this._masterIndex.removeCollection()` to remove collection metadata.

**Observations:**
*   The strong reliance on `MasterIndex` (which uses `ScriptPropertiesService` in Google Apps Script) is a key architectural decision for cross-instance coordination. This is essential in a serverless environment where multiple script executions might run concurrently.
*   The `MasterIndex` methods are wrapped in `try-catch` blocks in `_addCollectionToMasterIndex` and `_removeCollectionFromMasterIndex`, but errors are only logged as warnings and not re-thrown. This suggests that `MasterIndex` failures are considered non-critical for the immediate database operation, allowing the database to continue functioning, albeit potentially with an inconsistent master index. This design choice prioritizes availability over strict consistency in some scenarios, which might be acceptable depending on the application's requirements.

### Interactions with `Collection.js`

*   **Instantiation:** `Collection` objects are instantiated via the private method `_createCollectionObject`.
    *   `_createCollectionObject(name, driveFileId)`: This method returns `new Collection(name, driveFileId, this, this._fileService);`. This means each `Collection` instance receives a reference to the `Database` instance (`this`) and the `FileService`.
*   **Lazy Loading:** The comment in `_createCollectionObject` explicitly states: "Collections are lazy-loaded so this method doesn't load the full collection into memory until a CRUD operation on it is called." This is a significant optimization, preventing the database from loading all collecti
